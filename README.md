# Energy Efficiency Enhancement using Neural Networks
> This study looked into assessing the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency) as a function of building parameters.
The project was done as part of Machine Learning class at the University of Texas at Dallas.
The entire summary of the project can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/harshbg/Energy-Efficiency-Enhancement-using-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Energy%20Efficiency%20Analysis%20.ipynb)

## General info

The goal of the study is to understand various machine learning classification algorithms and their performance. 
We have added the cooling load and heating load, which can define the overall load of the apartment. We have studied the trend of the overall load by dividing it into three classes. 

## Technologies and Tools
* Python 3.5
* TensorFlow

## Setup

The dataset used and its metadata can be found in the [dataset](https://github.com/harshbg/Energy-Efficiency-Enhancement-using-Neural-Networks/tree/master/data). 
The jupyter notebook can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/harshbg/Energy-Efficiency-Enhancement-using-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Energy%20Efficiency%20Analysis%20.ipynb) and can be used to reproduce the result. 
Installation of TensorFlow would be required to run all the models. 
You can find the instructions to install TensorFlow in [installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

## Process

* We have added the cooling load and heating load which will define the overall load of the apartment. 
* We studied the trend of overall load and divided it into three classes, low efficient, high efficient and average efficient.
* We first tried multioutput machine learning regressor models like KNN, logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, linear & kernelized SVM. 
* After that we created a neural network classification model to further increase the accuracy of the classification to 97%.
